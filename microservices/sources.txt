Foundational & Conceptual
These help you understand why microservices exist, architectural principles, and trade-offs.

1. Building Microservices (2nd Edition) ‚Äî Sam Newman
The ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù microservices book. Covers core concepts, service boundaries, communication patterns, deployment, and organizational impacts.

2. Microservices Patterns ‚Äî Chris Richardson (2nd Edition)
Deep dive into patterns like Saga, CQRS, Event Sourcing, API Gateway, and handling distributed data. Includes Java/Spring examples, but concepts are universal.

3. The Art of Scalability ‚Äî Martin L. Abbott & Michael T. Fisher
Explains scaling from people to process to technology ‚Äî valuable for understanding microservices in a growing system.

Design & Best Practices
For people building or migrating systems to microservices.

4. Monolith to Microservices ‚Äî Sam Newman
Practical guidance on decomposing a monolith step-by-step without causing chaos.

5. Designing Distributed Systems ‚Äî Brendan Burns
Written by a Kubernetes co-founder, it focuses on reusable patterns for cloud-native microservices.

6. Fundamentals of Software Architecture ‚Äî Mark Richards & Neal Ford
Not microservices-only, but compares architecture styles, including when not to choose microservices.

Operations, Reliability & Scaling
If you already know microservices theory and want to run them in production.

7. Release It! (2nd Edition) ‚Äî Michael T. Nygard
Essential reading on building resilient, fault-tolerant services that survive production chaos.

8. Site Reliability Engineering ‚Äî Google SRE Team
Explains reliability practices for distributed systems ‚Äî applies heavily to microservices.

9. Cloud Native Patterns ‚Äî Cornelia Davis
Practical patterns for building scalable, reliable services in a cloud-native way.

Domain-Driven Design & Service Boundaries
Microservices live or die based on the right boundaries.

10. Domain-Driven Design ‚Äî Eric Evans (the blue book)
The original ‚Äî tough read but explains the strategic thinking behind bounded contexts.

11. Implementing Domain-Driven Design ‚Äî Vaughn Vernon
More practical than Evans‚Äô book, with examples for service decomposition.

12. Team Topologies ‚Äî Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pais
Shows how to structure teams around services to avoid communication bottlenecks.

üí° Recommendation if you‚Äôre starting fresh:
Read Building Microservices ‚Üí Microservices Patterns ‚Üí Monolith to Microservices.
Then branch into resilience (Release It!) and team/org design (Team Topologies).
